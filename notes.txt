This algorithm divides the board into six parts and strikes the coin with full force:
a.) Two parts below the baseline
	For left lower part, striker is placed at 0.75 and hit a coin in this area
	and for right lower part, striker is placed at 0.25 and hit a coin in this area.
	If coins are in both areas then area with maximum number of coins are chosen.
b.) Third part is area between board wall and left vertical baseline.
	For this part, striker is placed at the 0 position and a coin in this area is hit.
c.) Fourth part is area between board wall and right vertical baseline.
        For this part, striker is placed at the 1 position and a coin in this area is hit.
	If both third and fourth part contain some coins then area with maximum number of coins
	are chosen.
d.) Rest of the board is divided into two equal half by a vertical line passing trough the middle
    of the board.
	Part with the maximum number of coins is chosen and a coin in that part is striked by the striker
	from middle position.
	
If none of the above satisfies the just select a coin randomly and then strike it from the middle with full force.
Queen is given higher preference while selecting a coin in the algorithm so that it can be covered early.
